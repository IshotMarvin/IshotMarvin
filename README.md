- Hi, I’m @IshotMarvin
- I'm a computational/theoretical physicist (PhD student), studying mechanical metamaterial networks through computational topology, e.g. persistent homology
- My undergraduate thesis research was a theoretical/computational study of quantum spin lattice systems
- My masters' research/thesis was purely experimental, working in a biophysics/nanotechnology/2-d material laboratory, working to develop devices to sequence DNA and characterize other biomolecules through graphene nanogaps
- I made this account to track my personal projects, to host my old thesis code for posterity, and as a repository for my current code (current PhD code is private)
- I’m currently learning to develop GUI programs in Python and integrate elements like interactive plots
- I’m writing software that is fun and interests me (e.g. dice roller and statistics calculator, symbolic calculator, etc.)
