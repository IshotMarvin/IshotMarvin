- Hi, I’m @IshotMarvin
- I'm an experimental condensed matter physics Ph.D. student studying 2D material growth and characterization
- My undergraduate thesis was a theoretical/computational study of quantum spin lattice systems
- My current and recent research don't require much coding, and where coding is used is mostly just data analysis
- I miss doing more interesting coding, so I made this account to track my personal projects (and to host my old thesis code for posterity)
- I’m currently learning to develop GUI programs in Python and integrate elements like interactive plots
- I’m writing software that is fun and interests me (e.g. dice roller and statistics calculator, symbolic calculator, etc.)
