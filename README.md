- Hi, I’m @IshotMarvin
- I'm a computational/theoretical physicist, studying arbitrary flow network behavior through computational topology
- My undergraduate thesis was a theoretical/computational study of quantum spin lattice systems
- I made this account to track my personal projects, to host my old thesis code for posterity, and as a repository for my current code
- I’m currently learning to develop GUI programs in Python and integrate elements like interactive plots
- I’m writing software that is fun and interests me (e.g. dice roller and statistics calculator, symbolic calculator, etc.)
